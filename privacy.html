    </li>    
  </div>
  
  
  <p>
      <strong>Failure to provide personal data</strong>
      <strong></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      If I need to collect your personal data under the terms of a contract I
      have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, I may not
      be able to perform the contract I have or am trying to enter into with you.
      For example to provide you with goods and services. In this case I may have
      to cancel delivery of a product or service you may have requested from me -
      but I will notify you in this case.
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>How I use your data (The lawful basis for the processing)</strong>
      <strong></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Performance of contract</em>
      <u></u>
  </p>
  <p>
      In store / by email / by social media / by phone.
  </p>
  <p>
      This means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance
      of a contract to which you are a party, or to take steps at your request
      before entering into such a contract. For example, to communicate with you,
      to facilitate logistics and to provide payment to or to receive payment
      from you.
  </p>
  <p>
      <em>Legitimate interest</em>
      <u></u>
  </p>
  <p>
      Via my website - To monitor and improve the quality of my website platform.
  </p>
  <p>
      This means the interest of my business in conducting and managing my
      business to enable me to give you the best possible service / product and
      the most secure experience. I make sure I consider and balance any
      potential impact on you and your rights before I process your personal data
      for my legitimate interest. I will not use your personal data for
      activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless
      we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to by law)
  </p>
  <p>
      I would also use your data when you have given me your consent. This means
      you have opted to receive emails by contacting me directly with an enquiry.
  </p>

          <h1>Hi, I'm Tom</h1>
          <p>I tutor physics, biology and chemistry GCSE and chemistry A-level. I’ve had a passion for chemistry since I did my own A-levels. At university I realised how mind-blowing it is what atoms do 
            inside our bodies and my fate was set. I’ve been dedicated to lighting that same fire in others ever since. </p>

            It’s mostly me asking you what you like on your chips. Well, not quite, but when we begin a topic, I'll always look for a way
            to make it relatable. And you might not like chips, in which case I’ll find out whatever food you like with 
            salt and then we’ll talk about what holds the particles together in salt (ionic bonding). Then down the line I’ll ask you if 
            there’s anything else you like on chips and if you don’t like vinegar we’ll find something you do like which contains vinegar. 
            (Did you know there’s vinegar in ketchup?) Then we can talk about acids being proton donors, weak acids partially 
            dissociating, carboxylic acids being produced by the oxidation of ethanol and so on. Once you feel clearer about the theory,
            we'll look at some exam questions and then find another thing to learn. Over time this will  boost your confidence and raise 
            your grade.
