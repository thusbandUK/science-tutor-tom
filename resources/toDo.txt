configure health check contact form to only appear if there were no params, make usre it works, sends hidden code
connected to anonymised data, rejig intro text on intro page

so your other option is to call the anonymised code as the placeholder, no that won't work either, i think you really
just need to wait for them to get back to you

For the titration and hess cycle questions, you need to update the values for the inputs in both files

Okay, so when you've finished all the question content in the health check page you then need to copy that over to the submission
accepted page - BUT DON'T MESS WITH THE JAVASCRIPT CODE 

to be fair, you're best off making separate javascript files for each one and then you don't have to worry about that

you also need to review the metadata for both 

so yeah, yellow box if they got it right red if wrong, which you can tell by comparing the local storage object to the correctAnswer
object, key value by key value





done 

you need to give each question-containing div an id of the form id="question-x" - make sure it matches the id passed to 
decoration function in terms of lower / upper case q and the use of a dash, then restore the code in decoration function 
that decorates

and you need to adjust the code so that the netlify submission actually gets the data 

and you need to finish the questions and images and slot them in. This will have been a long day!!

you might want to look at areTheyCorrect.js and disabledCheckbox.js both in misc javascript snippets in the full stack codecad folder
