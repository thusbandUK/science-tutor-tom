Okay, so when you've finished all the question content in the health check page you then need to copy that over to the submission
accepted page - BUT DON'T MESS WITH THE JAVASCRIPT CODE 

to be fair, you're best off making separate javascript files for each one and then you don't have to worry about that

you also need to review the metadata for both 

so yeah, yellow box if they got it right red if wrong, which you can tell by comparing the local storage object to the correctAnswer
object, key value by key value

and you need to adjust the code so that the netlify submission actually gets the data 

and you need to finish the questions and images and slot them in. This will have been a long day!!

you might want to look at areTheyCorrect.js and disabledCheckbox.js both in misc javascript snippets in the full stack codecad folder
